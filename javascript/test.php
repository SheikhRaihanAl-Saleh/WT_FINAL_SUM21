<p id="bd_info" style="display: none;">
The riverine country of Bangladesh (“Land of the Bengals”)<br>
is one of the most densely populated countries in the world,<br> 
and its people are predominantly Muslim. As the eastern portion <br>
of the historical region of Bengal, the area once formed, <br>
along with what is now the Indian state of West Bengal, <br>
the province of Bengal in British India. <br>
With the partition of India in 1947, <br>
it became the Pakistani province of East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan),<br> 
one of five provinces of Pakistan, separated from the other four by 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of Indian territory.<br> 
In 1971 it became the independent country of Bangladesh.
